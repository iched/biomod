                <p>Antibiotics contain diverse functional groups—such as imidazole, amino, hydroxyl, phenyl, and pyridine moieties—that can effectively displace chloride ions in hemin and serve as axial ligands to the Fe–N<sub>4</sub> planar center, forming a pentacoordinated structure. These units can further self-assemble into nanoaggregates through various non-covalent interactions, including hydrogen bonding, salt bridges, π–π stacking, and cation-π interactions, ultimately leading to the co-assembly of antibiotic-integrated nanozymes.</p>

                <p>iv.	The fixed bacterial samples were centrifuged and washed three times with ddH₂O. Subsequently, they were subjected to sequential dehydration in a graded ethanol series (50%, 70%, 85%, 95%, and 100%). After critical point drying, the specimens were sputter-coated and imaged using a scanning electron microscope to examine the surface morphology.</p>

                <p>The bacterial suspension cultured overnight was transferred and activated for 6h. A 1 mL aliquot of the fungal suspension was taken from each centrifuge tube, centrifuged, and the supernatant was discarded. The drug-resistant working suspension was then treated with FCZ (Hemin) (at a final concentration of 1 mg mL-1), while the drug-resistant bacteria treated with FCZ and Hemin were used as the control group. The samples were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, followed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging.</p>

                <p>i. Overnight bacterial culture was subcultured and activated for 4 h to approximately 1×10⁹ CFU/mL for subsequent use.</p>
                <p>ii. A 24-well plate was prepared with cell climbing slides, and 1 mL of bacterial suspension was added to each well. The plate was incubated at 37°C for 24 h to allow biofilm formation.</p>
                <p>The medium was carefully aspirated, and 1 mL of 100 μg/mL gentamicin nanozyme or control solutions was gently added along the well wall. The plate was incubated at 37°C for 3 h.</p>
                <p>iv. After treatment, the liquid was removed, and biofilms were stained with 0.5 μM SYTO 9 solution at 37°C in the dark for 30 min. The slides were then washed with PBS and carefully retrieved.</p>
                <p>v. Each slide was mounted inverted on a clean glass slide with 5 μL of anti-fade mounting medium and imaged using confocal laser scanning microscopy.</p>
